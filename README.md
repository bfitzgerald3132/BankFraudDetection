<h1>Bank Fraud Detection</h1>

<p>This project uses this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022">Kaggle dataset</a> to model bank fraud in transactions based on data from 2022.</p>

<p>Work in progress. Accuracy > 98%, but FPR (which creators recommend as a better metric) < 1.14%. Dataset contains intentionally placed group biases, which I will address later.</p>
